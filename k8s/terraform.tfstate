When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that\n                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when\n                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as\n                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.\n\n                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;\n                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at\n                  which to namespace this status.\n\n                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for\n                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST\n                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list\n                  that they are responsible for.\n\n                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs\n                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef\n                  and ControllerName fields combined.\n\n                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list\n                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.\n\n                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.\n                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that\n                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced\n                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no\n                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by\n                  the BackendTLSPolicy.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an\n                    associated Ancestor.\n\n                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it\n                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the\n                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and\n                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most\n                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations\n                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers\n                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.\n\n                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which\n                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy\n                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.\n\n                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the\n                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same\n                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying\n                    implementations.\n\n                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is\n                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.\n                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the\n                    ancestor object referred to in this status.\n\n                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the\n                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.\n\n                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,\n                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.\n                  properties:\n                    ancestorRef:\n                      description: |-\n                        AncestorRef corresponds with a ParentRef in the spec that this\n                        PolicyAncestorStatus struct describes the status of.\n                      properties:\n                        group:\n                          default: gateway.networking.k8s.io\n                          description: |-\n                            Group is the group of the referent.\n                            When unspecified, \"gateway.networking.k8s.io\" is inferred.\n                            To set the core API group (such as for a \"Service\" kind referent),\n                            Group must be explicitly set to \"\" (empty string).\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          pattern: ^$|^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                        kind:\n                          default: Gateway\n                          description: |-\n                            Kind is kind of the referent.\n\n                            There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                            * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                            Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.\n                          maxLength: 63\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-zA-Z]([-a-zA-Z0-9]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$\n                          type: string\n                        name:\n                          description: |-\n                            Name is the name of the referent.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          type: string\n                        namespace:\n                          description: |-\n                            Namespace is the namespace of the referent.

When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that\n                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when\n                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as\n                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.\n\n                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;\n                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at\n                  which to namespace this status.\n\n                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for\n                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST\n                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list\n                  that they are responsible for.\n\n                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs\n                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef\n                  and ControllerName fields combined.\n\n                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list\n                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.\n\n                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.\n                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that\n                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced\n                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no\n                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by\n                  the BackendTLSPolicy.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an\n                    associated Ancestor.\n\n                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it\n                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the\n                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and\n                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most\n                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations\n                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers\n                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.\n\n                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which\n                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy\n                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.\n\n                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the\n                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same\n                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying\n                    implementations.\n\n                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is\n                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.\n                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the\n                    ancestor object referred to in this status.\n\n                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the\n                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.\n\n                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,\n                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.\n                  properties:\n                    ancestorRef:\n                      description: |-\n                        AncestorRef corresponds with a ParentRef in the spec that this\n                        PolicyAncestorStatus struct describes the status of.\n                      properties:\n                        group:\n                          default: gateway.networking.k8s.io\n                          description: |-\n                            Group is the group of the referent.\n                            When unspecified, \"gateway.networking.k8s.io\" is inferred.\n                            To set the core API group (such as for a \"Service\" kind referent),\n                            Group must be explicitly set to \"\" (empty string).\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          pattern: ^$|^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                        kind:\n                          default: Gateway\n                          description: |-\n                            Kind is kind of the referent.\n\n                            There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                            * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                            Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.\n                          maxLength: 63\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-zA-Z]([-a-zA-Z0-9]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$\n                          type: string\n                        name:\n                          description: |-\n                            Name is the name of the referent.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          type: string\n                        namespace:\n                          description: |-\n                            Namespace is the namespace of the referent.

For example, Gateway\n                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from\n                            the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the\n                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                      required:\n                      - name\n                      type: object\n                    conditions:\n                      description: Conditions describes the status of the Policy with\n                        respect to the given Ancestor.\n                      items:\n                        description: Condition contains details for one aspect of\n                          the current state of this API Resource.\n                        properties:\n                          lastTransitionTime:\n                            description: |-\n                              lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.\n                              This should be when the underlying condition changed.

Listeners define\n                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.\n                  At least one Listener MUST be specified.\n\n                  ## Distinct Listeners\n\n                  Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)\n                  MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to\n                  exactly one listener. (This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n                  \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\n                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\n                  apply in that case).\n\n                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\n                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\n                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects\n                  they support:\n\n                  HTTPRoute\n\n                  1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP\n                  2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided\n\n                  TLSRoute\n\n                  1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n                  \"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n                  **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\n                  Listener**.\n\n                  When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\n                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\n                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\n                  Listener fields.\n\n                  When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then\n                  each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different\n                  values for other fields.\n\n                  The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.\n                  The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for\n                  Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the\n                  Gateway API spec.\n\n                  The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_\n                  values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:\n\n                  * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname\n                  * **TCP, UDP**: Port\n\n                  One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an\n                  implementation:\n\n                  * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol\n                    Listeners, and\n                  * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP\n                    Protocol.\n\n                  In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the\n                  TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.\n\n                  If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the\n                  previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be\n                  accepted.\n\n                  Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because\n                  Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.\n\n                  ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname\n\n                  When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request\n                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\n                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n                  Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\n                  matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\n                  matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n                  `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\n                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\n                  For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n\n                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\n                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\n                  the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n                  `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n                  ## Handling indistinct Listeners\n\n                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\n                  Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\n                  condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n                  The words \"indistinct\" and \"conflicted\" are considered equivalent for the\n                  purpose of this documentation.\n\n                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\n                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\n                  no Conflicted Listeners.\n\n                  Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to\n                  the following rules:\n\n                  * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.\n                    ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.\n                  * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively\n                    contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.\n\n                  The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\n                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\n                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\n                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\n                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\n                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n                  ## General Listener behavior\n\n                  Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.\n                  For example, if Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\n                  request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\n                  to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n\n                  This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\", and it is an Extended feature\n                  of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST\n                  clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the\n                  `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.\n\n                  Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support\n                  for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated\n                  conformance tests.\n\n                  ## Compatible Listeners\n\n                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:\n\n                  1. They are distinct.\n                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n                     addresses.\n\n                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\n                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\n                  may not be compatible for another.\n\n                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\n                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\n                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of\n                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\n                  In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.\n\n                  Support: Core\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    Listener embodies the concept of a logical endpoint where a Gateway accepts\n                    network connections.\n                  properties:\n                    allowedRoutes:\n                      default:\n                        namespaces:\n                          from: Same\n                      description: |-\n                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a\n                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be\n                        present.\n\n                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule\n                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be\n                        determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.\n                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with\n                          a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over\n                          a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\".\n                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in\n                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence.

Listeners define\n                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.\n                  At least one Listener MUST be specified.\n\n                  ## Distinct Listeners\n\n                  Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)\n                  MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to\n                  exactly one listener. (This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n                  \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\n                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\n                  apply in that case).\n\n                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\n                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\n                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects\n                  they support:\n\n                  HTTPRoute\n\n                  1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP\n                  2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided\n\n                  TLSRoute\n\n                  1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n                  \"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n                  **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\n                  Listener**.\n\n                  When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\n                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\n                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\n                  Listener fields.\n\n                  When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then\n                  each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different\n                  values for other fields.\n\n                  The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.\n                  The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for\n                  Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the\n                  Gateway API spec.\n\n                  The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_\n                  values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:\n\n                  * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname\n                  * **TCP, UDP**: Port\n\n                  One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an\n                  implementation:\n\n                  * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol\n                    Listeners, and\n                  * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP\n                    Protocol.\n\n                  In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the\n                  TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.\n\n                  If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the\n                  previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be\n                  accepted.\n\n                  Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because\n                  Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.\n\n                  ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname\n\n                  When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request\n                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\n                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n                  Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\n                  matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\n                  matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n                  `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\n                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\n                  For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n\n                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\n                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\n                  the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n                  `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n                  ## Handling indistinct Listeners\n\n                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\n                  Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\n                  condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n                  The words \"indistinct\" and \"conflicted\" are considered equivalent for the\n                  purpose of this documentation.\n\n                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\n                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\n                  no Conflicted Listeners.\n\n                  Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to\n                  the following rules:\n\n                  * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.\n                    ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.\n                  * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively\n                    contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.\n\n                  The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\n                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\n                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\n                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\n                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\n                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n                  ## General Listener behavior\n\n                  Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.\n                  For example, if Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\n                  request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\n                  to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n\n                  This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\", and it is an Extended feature\n                  of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST\n                  clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the\n                  `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.\n\n                  Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support\n                  for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated\n                  conformance tests.\n\n                  ## Compatible Listeners\n\n                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:\n\n                  1. They are distinct.\n                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n                     addresses.\n\n                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\n                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\n                  may not be compatible for another.\n\n                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\n                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\n                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of\n                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\n                  In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.\n\n                  Support: Core\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    Listener embodies the concept of a logical endpoint where a Gateway accepts\n                    network connections.\n                  properties:\n                    allowedRoutes:\n                      default:\n                        namespaces:\n                          from: Same\n                      description: |-\n                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a\n                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be\n                        present.\n\n                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule\n                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be\n                        determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.\n                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with\n                          a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over\n                          a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\".\n                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in\n                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence.

On the other\n                    hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.\n\n                  Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted\n                  as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match\n                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.\n\n                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any\n                  GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be\n                  ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the\n                  GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,\n                  `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.\n\n                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none\n                  match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by\n                  the implementation.

ReferenceGrant is\n                  not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to\n                  create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the\n                  Route.\n\n                  There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                  * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent\n                  resources.\n\n                  ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n                  * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n                    be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n                    each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n                    optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n                    combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\n                  Some examples:\n\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n                    same object must also set `sectionName`.\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n                    object must also set `port`.\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n                    referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\n                  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may\n                  be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may\n                  choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the\n                  case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be\n                  merged.\n\n                  Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific\n                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly\n                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,\n                  Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a\n                  generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered\n                    a parent of this resource (usually a route).

An empty list\n                  means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    RouteParentStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an\n                    associated Parent.\n                  properties:\n                    conditions:\n                      description: |-\n                        Conditions describes the status of the route with respect to the Gateway.\n                        Note that the route's availability is also subject to the Gateway's own\n                        status conditions and listener status.\n\n                        If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports\n                        Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,\n                        then that Gateway's controller MUST set the \"Accepted\" condition on the\n                        Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the\n                        Gateway, and why.\n\n                        A Route MUST be considered \"Accepted\" if at least one of the Route's\n                        rules is implemented by the Gateway.\n\n                        There are a number of cases where the \"Accepted\" condition may not be set\n                        due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:\n\n                        * The Route refers to a nonexistent parent.\n                        * The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.\n                        * The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.\n                      items:\n                        description: Condition contains details for one aspect of\n                          the current state of this API Resource.\n                        properties:\n                          lastTransitionTime:\n                            description: |-\n                              lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.\n                              This should be when the underlying condition changed.

For example:\n\n                  * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at\n                    least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.\n                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least\n                    one hostname that matches the Listener hostname.

That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match\n                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.\n\n                  If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any\n                  HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be\n                  ignored.

When both Port (experimental) and SectionName\n                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match\n                        both specified values.\n\n                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.\n                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is\n                        interpreted.\n\n                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.\n                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at\n                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway\n                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from\n                        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the\n                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                        Support: Core\n                      maxLength: 253\n                      minLength: 1\n                      pattern: ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                      type: string\n                  required:\n                  - name\n                  type: object\n                maxItems: 32\n                type: array\n                x-kubernetes-list-type: atomic\n                x-kubernetes-validations:\n                - message: sectionName must be specified when parentRefs includes\n                    2 or more references to the same parent\n                  rule: 'self.all(p1, self.all(p2, p1.group == p2.group \u0026\u0026 p1.kind\n                    == p2.kind \u0026\u0026 p1.name == p2.name \u0026\u0026 (((!has(p1.__namespace__)\n                    || p1.__namespace__ == '''') \u0026\u0026 (!has(p2.__namespace__) || p2.__namespace__\n                    == '''')) || (has(p1.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026 has(p2.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026\n                    p1.__namespace__ == p2.__namespace__ )) ?

For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all\n                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.\n\n                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.\n                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in\n                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.\n\n                                            Request Path | Prefix Match | Replace Prefix | Modified Path\n                                          maxLength: 1024\n                                          type: string\n                                        type:\n                                          description: |-\n                                            Type defines the type of path modifier.

For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all\n                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.\n\n                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.\n                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in\n                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.\n\n                                            Request Path | Prefix Match | Replace Prefix | Modified Path\n                                          maxLength: 1024\n                                          type: string\n                                        type:\n                                          description: |-\n                                            Type defines the type of path modifier.

When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that\n                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when\n                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as\n                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.\n\n                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;\n                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at\n                  which to namespace this status.\n\n                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for\n                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST\n                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list\n                  that they are responsible for.\n\n                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs\n                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef\n                  and ControllerName fields combined.\n\n                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list\n                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.\n\n                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.\n                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that\n                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced\n                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no\n                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by\n                  the BackendTLSPolicy.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an\n                    associated Ancestor.\n\n                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it\n                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the\n                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and\n                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most\n                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations\n                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers\n                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.\n\n                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which\n                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy\n                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.\n\n                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the\n                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same\n                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying\n                    implementations.\n\n                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is\n                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.\n                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the\n                    ancestor object referred to in this status.\n\n                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the\n                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.\n\n                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,\n                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.\n                  properties:\n                    ancestorRef:\n                      description: |-\n                        AncestorRef corresponds with a ParentRef in the spec that this\n                        PolicyAncestorStatus struct describes the status of.\n                      properties:\n                        group:\n                          default: gateway.networking.k8s.io\n                          description: |-\n                            Group is the group of the referent.\n                            When unspecified, \"gateway.networking.k8s.io\" is inferred.\n                            To set the core API group (such as for a \"Service\" kind referent),\n                            Group must be explicitly set to \"\" (empty string).\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          pattern: ^$|^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                        kind:\n                          default: Gateway\n                          description: |-\n                            Kind is kind of the referent.\n\n                            There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                            * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                            Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.\n                          maxLength: 63\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-zA-Z]([-a-zA-Z0-9]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$\n                          type: string\n                        name:\n                          description: |-\n                            Name is the name of the referent.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          type: string\n                        namespace:\n                          description: |-\n                            Namespace is the namespace of the referent.

For example, Gateway\n                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from\n                            the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the\n                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                      required:\n                      - name\n                      type: object\n                    conditions:\n                      description: Conditions describes the status of the Policy with\n                        respect to the given Ancestor.\n                      items:\n                        description: Condition contains details for one aspect of\n                          the current state of this API Resource.\n                        properties:\n                          lastTransitionTime:\n                            description: |-\n                              lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.\n                              This should be when the underlying condition changed.

An empty list\n                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.\n\n                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.\n                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that\n                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced\n                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no\n                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by\n                  the BackendTLSPolicy.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an\n                    associated Ancestor.\n\n                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it\n                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the\n                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and\n                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most\n                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations\n                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers\n                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.\n\n                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which\n                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy\n                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.\n\n                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the\n                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same\n                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying\n                    implementations.\n\n                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is\n                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.\n                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the\n                    ancestor object referred to in this status.\n\n                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the\n                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.\n\n                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,\n                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.\n                  properties:\n                    ancestorRef:\n                      description: |-\n                        AncestorRef corresponds with a ParentRef in the spec that this\n                        PolicyAncestorStatus struct describes the status of.\n                      properties:\n                        group:\n                          default: gateway.networking.k8s.io\n                          description: |-\n                            Group is the group of the referent.\n                            When unspecified, \"gateway.networking.k8s.io\" is inferred.\n                            To set the core API group (such as for a \"Service\" kind referent),\n                            Group must be explicitly set to \"\" (empty string).\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          pattern: ^$|^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                        kind:\n                          default: Gateway\n                          description: |-\n                            Kind is kind of the referent.\n\n                            There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                            * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                            Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.\n                          maxLength: 63\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-zA-Z]([-a-zA-Z0-9]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$\n                          type: string\n                        name:\n                          description: |-\n                            Name is the name of the referent.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          type: string\n                        namespace:\n                          description: |-\n                            Namespace is the namespace of the referent.

It can be interpreted\n                            differently based on the type of parent resource.\n\n                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners\n                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and\n                            select this Route).

For example, Gateway\n                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                            namespace, or hostname.

Listeners define\n                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.\n                  At least one Listener MUST be specified.\n\n                  ## Distinct Listeners\n\n                  Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)\n                  MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to\n                  exactly one listener. (This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n                  \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\n                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\n                  apply in that case).\n\n                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\n                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\n                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects\n                  they support:\n\n                  HTTPRoute\n\n                  1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP\n                  2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided\n\n                  TLSRoute\n\n                  1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n                  \"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n                  **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\n                  Listener**.\n\n                  When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\n                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\n                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\n                  Listener fields.\n\n                  When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then\n                  each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different\n                  values for other fields.\n\n                  The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.\n                  The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for\n                  Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the\n                  Gateway API spec.\n\n                  The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_\n                  values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:\n\n                  * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname\n                  * **TCP, UDP**: Port\n\n                  One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an\n                  implementation:\n\n                  * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol\n                    Listeners, and\n                  * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP\n                    Protocol.\n\n                  In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the\n                  TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.\n\n                  If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the\n                  previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be\n                  accepted.\n\n                  Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because\n                  Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.\n\n                  ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname\n\n                  When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request\n                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\n                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n                  Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\n                  matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\n                  matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n                  `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\n                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\n                  For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n\n                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\n                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\n                  the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n                  `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n                  ## Handling indistinct Listeners\n\n                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\n                  Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\n                  condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n                  The words \"indistinct\" and \"conflicted\" are considered equivalent for the\n                  purpose of this documentation.\n\n                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\n                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\n                  no Conflicted Listeners.\n\n                  Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to\n                  the following rules:\n\n                  * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.\n                    ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.\n                  * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively\n                    contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.\n\n                  The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\n                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\n                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\n                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\n                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\n                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n                  ## General Listener behavior\n\n                  Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.\n                  For example, if Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\n                  request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\n                  to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n\n                  This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\", and it is an Extended feature\n                  of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST\n                  clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the\n                  `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.\n\n                  Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support\n                  for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated\n                  conformance tests.\n\n                  ## Compatible Listeners\n\n                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:\n\n                  1. They are distinct.\n                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n                     addresses.\n\n                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\n                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\n                  may not be compatible for another.\n\n                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\n                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\n                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of\n                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\n                  In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.\n\n                  Support: Core\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    Listener embodies the concept of a logical endpoint where a Gateway accepts\n                    network connections.\n                  properties:\n                    allowedRoutes:\n                      default:\n                        namespaces:\n                          from: Same\n                      description: |-\n                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a\n                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be\n                        present.\n\n                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule\n                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be\n                        determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.\n                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with\n                          a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over\n                          a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\".\n                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in\n                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence.

Listeners define\n                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.\n                  At least one Listener MUST be specified.\n\n                  ## Distinct Listeners\n\n                  Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)\n                  MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to\n                  exactly one listener. (This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n                  \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\n                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\n                  apply in that case).\n\n                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\n                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\n                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects\n                  they support:\n\n                  HTTPRoute\n\n                  1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP\n                  2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided\n\n                  TLSRoute\n\n                  1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n                  \"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n                  **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\n                  Listener**.\n\n                  When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\n                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\n                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\n                  Listener fields.\n\n                  When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then\n                  each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different\n                  values for other fields.\n\n                  The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.\n                  The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for\n                  Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the\n                  Gateway API spec.\n\n                  The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_\n                  values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:\n\n                  * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname\n                  * **TCP, UDP**: Port\n\n                  One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an\n                  implementation:\n\n                  * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol\n                    Listeners, and\n                  * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP\n                    Protocol.\n\n                  In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the\n                  TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.\n\n                  If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the\n                  previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be\n                  accepted.\n\n                  Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because\n                  Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.\n\n                  ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname\n\n                  When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request\n                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\n                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n                  Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\n                  matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\n                  matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n                  `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\n                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\n                  For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n\n                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\n                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\n                  the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n                  `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n                  ## Handling indistinct Listeners\n\n                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\n                  Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\n                  condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n                  The words \"indistinct\" and \"conflicted\" are considered equivalent for the\n                  purpose of this documentation.\n\n                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\n                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\n                  no Conflicted Listeners.\n\n                  Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to\n                  the following rules:\n\n                  * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.\n                    ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.\n                  * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively\n                    contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.\n\n                  The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\n                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\n                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\n                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\n                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\n                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n                  ## General Listener behavior\n\n                  Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.\n                  For example, if Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\n                  request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\n                  to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n\n                  This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\", and it is an Extended feature\n                  of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST\n                  clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the\n                  `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.\n\n                  Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support\n                  for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated\n                  conformance tests.\n\n                  ## Compatible Listeners\n\n                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:\n\n                  1. They are distinct.\n                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n                     addresses.\n\n                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\n                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\n                  may not be compatible for another.\n\n                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\n                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\n                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of\n                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\n                  In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.\n\n                  Support: Core\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    Listener embodies the concept of a logical endpoint where a Gateway accepts\n                    network connections.\n                  properties:\n                    allowedRoutes:\n                      default:\n                        namespaces:\n                          from: Same\n                      description: |-\n                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a\n                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be\n                        present.\n\n                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule\n                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be\n                        determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.\n                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with\n                          a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over\n                          a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\".\n                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in\n                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence.

On the other\n                    hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.\n\n                  Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted\n                  as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match\n                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.\n\n                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any\n                  GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be\n                  ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the\n                  GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,\n                  `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.\n\n                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none\n                  match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by\n                  the implementation.

ReferenceGrant is\n                  not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to\n                  create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the\n                  Route.\n\n                  There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                  * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent\n                  resources.\n\n                  ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n                  * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n                    be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n                    each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n                    optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n                    combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\n                  Some examples:\n\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n                    same object must also set `sectionName`.\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n                    object must also set `port`.\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n                    referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\n                  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may\n                  be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may\n                  choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the\n                  case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be\n                  merged.\n\n                  Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific\n                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly\n                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,\n                  Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a\n                  generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered\n                    a parent of this resource (usually a route).

An empty list\n                  means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    RouteParentStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an\n                    associated Parent.\n                  properties:\n                    conditions:\n                      description: |-\n                        Conditions describes the status of the route with respect to the Gateway.\n                        Note that the route's availability is also subject to the Gateway's own\n                        status conditions and listener status.\n\n                        If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports\n                        Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,\n                        then that Gateway's controller MUST set the \"Accepted\" condition on the\n                        Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the\n                        Gateway, and why.\n\n                        A Route MUST be considered \"Accepted\" if at least one of the Route's\n                        rules is implemented by the Gateway.\n\n                        There are a number of cases where the \"Accepted\" condition may not be set\n                        due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:\n\n                        * The Route refers to a nonexistent parent.\n                        * The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.\n                        * The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.\n                      items:\n                        description: Condition contains details for one aspect of\n                          the current state of this API Resource.\n                        properties:\n                          lastTransitionTime:\n                            description: |-\n                              lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.\n                              This should be when the underlying condition changed.

For example:\n\n                  * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at\n                    least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.\n                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least\n                    one hostname that matches the Listener hostname.

That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match\n                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.\n\n                  If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any\n                  HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be\n                  ignored.

When both Port (experimental) and SectionName\n                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match\n                        both specified values.\n\n                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.\n                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is\n                        interpreted.\n\n                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.\n                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at\n                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway\n                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from\n                        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the\n                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                        Support: Core\n                      maxLength: 253\n                      minLength: 1\n                      pattern: ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                      type: string\n                  required:\n                  - name\n                  type: object\n                maxItems: 32\n                type: array\n                x-kubernetes-list-type: atomic\n                x-kubernetes-validations:\n                - message: sectionName must be specified when parentRefs includes\n                    2 or more references to the same parent\n                  rule: 'self.all(p1, self.all(p2, p1.group == p2.group \u0026\u0026 p1.kind\n                    == p2.kind \u0026\u0026 p1.name == p2.name \u0026\u0026 (((!has(p1.__namespace__)\n                    || p1.__namespace__ == '''') \u0026\u0026 (!has(p2.__namespace__) || p2.__namespace__\n                    == '''')) || (has(p1.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026 has(p2.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026\n                    p1.__namespace__ == p2.__namespace__ )) ?

For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all\n                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.\n\n                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.\n                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in\n                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.\n\n                                            Request Path | Prefix Match | Replace Prefix | Modified Path\n                                          maxLength: 1024\n                                          type: string\n                                        type:\n                                          description: |-\n                                            Type defines the type of path modifier.

For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all\n                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.\n\n                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.\n                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in\n                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.\n\n                                            Request Path | Prefix Match | Replace Prefix | Modified Path\n                                          maxLength: 1024\n                                          type: string\n                                        type:\n                                          description: |-\n                                            Type defines the type of path modifier.

This means either that:\n\n                  * They select different targets. If this is the case, then targetRef\n                    entries are distinct.

For\n                    example, a policy with a creation timestamp of \"2021-07-15\n                    01:02:03\" MUST be given precedence over a policy with a\n                    creation timestamp of \"2021-07-15 01:02:04\".\n                  * The policy appearing first in alphabetical order by {name}.\n                    For example, a policy named `bar` is given precedence over a\n                    policy named `baz`.\n\n                  For any BackendTLSPolicy that does not take precedence, the\n                  implementation MUST ensure the `Accepted` Condition is set to\n                  `status: False`, with Reason `Conflicted`.\n\n                  Implementations SHOULD NOT support more than one targetRef at this\n                  time. Although the API technically allows for this, the current guidance\n                  for conflict resolution and status handling is lacking.

An empty list\n                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.\n\n                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.\n                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that\n                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced\n                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no\n                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by\n                  the BackendTLSPolicy.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an\n                    associated Ancestor.\n\n                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it\n                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the\n                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and\n                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most\n                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations\n                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers\n                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.\n\n                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which\n                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy\n                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.\n\n                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the\n                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same\n                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying\n                    implementations.\n\n                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is\n                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.\n                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the\n                    ancestor object referred to in this status.\n\n                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the\n                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.\n\n                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,\n                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.\n                  properties:\n                    ancestorRef:\n                      description: |-\n                        AncestorRef corresponds with a ParentRef in the spec that this\n                        PolicyAncestorStatus struct describes the status of.\n                      properties:\n                        group:\n                          default: gateway.networking.k8s.io\n                          description: |-\n                            Group is the group of the referent.\n                            When unspecified, \"gateway.networking.k8s.io\" is inferred.\n                            To set the core API group (such as for a \"Service\" kind referent),\n                            Group must be explicitly set to \"\" (empty string).\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          pattern: ^$|^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                        kind:\n                          default: Gateway\n                          description: |-\n                            Kind is kind of the referent.\n\n                            There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                            * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                            Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.\n                          maxLength: 63\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-zA-Z]([-a-zA-Z0-9]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$\n                          type: string\n                        name:\n                          description: |-\n                            Name is the name of the referent.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          type: string\n                        namespace:\n                          description: |-\n                            Namespace is the namespace of the referent.

It can be interpreted\n                            differently based on the type of parent resource.\n\n                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners\n                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and\n                            select this Route).

For example, Gateway\n                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                            namespace, or hostname.

Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most\n                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations\n                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers\n                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.\n\n                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which\n                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy\n                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.\n\n                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the\n                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same\n                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying\n                    implementations.\n\n                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is\n                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.\n                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the\n                    ancestor object referred to in this status.\n\n                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the\n                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.\n\n                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,\n                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.\n                  properties:\n                    ancestorRef:\n                      description: |-\n                        AncestorRef corresponds with a ParentRef in the spec that this\n                        PolicyAncestorStatus struct describes the status of.\n                      properties:\n                        group:\n                          default: gateway.networking.k8s.io\n                          description: |-\n                            Group is the group of the referent.\n                            When unspecified, \"gateway.networking.k8s.io\" is inferred.\n                            To set the core API group (such as for a \"Service\" kind referent),\n                            Group must be explicitly set to \"\" (empty string).\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          pattern: ^$|^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                        kind:\n                          default: Gateway\n                          description: |-\n                            Kind is kind of the referent.\n\n                            There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                            * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                            Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.\n                          maxLength: 63\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-zA-Z]([-a-zA-Z0-9]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$\n                          type: string\n                        name:\n                          description: |-\n                            Name is the name of the referent.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          type: string\n                        namespace:\n                          description: |-\n                            Namespace is the namespace of the referent.

Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly\n                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:\n                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a\n                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 63\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$\n                          type: string\n                        port:\n                          description: |-\n                            Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted\n                            differently based on the type of parent resource.\n\n                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners\n                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and\n                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the\n                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port\n                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port\n                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener\n                            must match both specified values.\n\n                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.\n                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly\n                            document how/if Port is interpreted.\n\n                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as\n                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway\n                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment\n                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,\n                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                            Support: Extended\n                          format: int32\n                          maximum: 65535\n                          minimum: 1\n                          type: integer\n                        sectionName:\n                          description: |-\n                            SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource.

When both Port (experimental) and SectionName\n                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match\n                            both specified values.\n                            * Service: Port name.

Listeners define\n                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.\n                  At least one Listener MUST be specified.\n\n                  ## Distinct Listeners\n\n                  Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)\n                  MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to\n                  exactly one listener. (This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n                  \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\n                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\n                  apply in that case).\n\n                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\n                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\n                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects\n                  they support:\n\n                  HTTPRoute\n\n                  1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP\n                  2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided\n\n                  TLSRoute\n\n                  1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n                  \"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n                  **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\n                  Listener**.\n\n                  When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\n                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\n                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\n                  Listener fields.\n\n                  When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then\n                  each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different\n                  values for other fields.\n\n                  The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.\n                  The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for\n                  Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the\n                  Gateway API spec.\n\n                  The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_\n                  values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:\n\n                  * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname\n                  * **TCP, UDP**: Port\n\n                  One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an\n                  implementation:\n\n                  * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol\n                    Listeners, and\n                  * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP\n                    Protocol.\n\n                  In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the\n                  TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.\n\n                  If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the\n                  previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be\n                  accepted.\n\n                  Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because\n                  Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.\n\n                  ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname\n\n                  When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request\n                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\n                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n                  Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\n                  matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\n                  matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n                  `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\n                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\n                  For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n\n                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\n                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\n                  the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n                  `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n                  ## Handling indistinct Listeners\n\n                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\n                  Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\n                  condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n                  The words \"indistinct\" and \"conflicted\" are considered equivalent for the\n                  purpose of this documentation.\n\n                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\n                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\n                  no Conflicted Listeners.\n\n                  Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to\n                  the following rules:\n\n                  * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.\n                    ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.\n                  * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively\n                    contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.\n\n                  The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\n                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\n                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\n                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\n                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\n                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n                  ## General Listener behavior\n\n                  Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.\n                  For example, if Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\n                  request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\n                  to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n\n                  This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\", and it is an Extended feature\n                  of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST\n                  clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the\n                  `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.\n\n                  Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support\n                  for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated\n                  conformance tests.\n\n                  ## Compatible Listeners\n\n                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:\n\n                  1. They are distinct.\n                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n                     addresses.\n\n                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\n                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\n                  may not be compatible for another.\n\n                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\n                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\n                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of\n                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\n                  In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.\n\n                  Support: Core\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    Listener embodies the concept of a logical endpoint where a Gateway accepts\n                    network connections.\n                  properties:\n                    allowedRoutes:\n                      default:\n                        namespaces:\n                          from: Same\n                      description: |-\n                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a\n                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be\n                        present.\n\n                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule\n                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be\n                        determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.\n                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with\n                          a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over\n                          a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\".\n                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in\n                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence.

Listeners define\n                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.\n                  At least one Listener MUST be specified.\n\n                  ## Distinct Listeners\n\n                  Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)\n                  MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to\n                  exactly one listener. (This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than\n                  \"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration\n                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_\n                  apply in that case).\n\n                  Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique\n                  combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.\n\n                  Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered\n                  Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects\n                  they support:\n\n                  HTTPRoute\n\n                  1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP\n                  2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided\n\n                  TLSRoute\n\n                  1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough\n\n                  \"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:\n\n                  **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct\n                  Listener**.\n\n                  When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for\n                  example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation\n                  can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other\n                  Listener fields.\n\n                  When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then\n                  each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different\n                  values for other fields.\n\n                  The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.\n                  The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for\n                  Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the\n                  Gateway API spec.\n\n                  The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_\n                  values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:\n\n                  * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname\n                  * **TCP, UDP**: Port\n\n                  One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an\n                  implementation:\n\n                  * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol\n                    Listeners, and\n                  * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP\n                    Protocol.\n\n                  In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the\n                  TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.\n\n                  If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the\n                  previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be\n                  accepted.\n\n                  Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because\n                  Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.\n\n                  ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname\n\n                  When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request\n                  hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname\n                  values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.\n\n                  Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard\n                  matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)\n                  matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over\n                  `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.\n\n                  Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific\n                  wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.\n                  For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.\n\n                  The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the\n                  hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.\n\n                  The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to\n                  the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both\n                  `\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.\n\n                  ## Handling indistinct Listeners\n\n                  If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those\n                  Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"\n                  condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".\n\n                  The words \"indistinct\" and \"conflicted\" are considered equivalent for the\n                  purpose of this documentation.\n\n                  Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted\n                  Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains\n                  no Conflicted Listeners.\n\n                  Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to\n                  the following rules:\n\n                  * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.\n                    ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.\n                  * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively\n                    contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.\n\n                  The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the\n                  Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or\n                  not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly\n                  indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are\n                  Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD\n                  indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.\n\n                  ## General Listener behavior\n\n                  Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.\n                  For example, if Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a\n                  request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached\n                  to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).\n\n                  This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\", and it is an Extended feature\n                  of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST\n                  clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the\n                  `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.\n\n                  Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support\n                  for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated\n                  conformance tests.\n\n                  ## Compatible Listeners\n\n                  A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:\n\n                  1. They are distinct.\n                  2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses\n                     requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned\n                     addresses.\n\n                  Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across\n                  implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation\n                  may not be compatible for another.\n\n                  For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners\n                  on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port\n                  would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.\n\n                  Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of\n                  Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.\n\n                  In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.\n\n                  Support: Core\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    Listener embodies the concept of a logical endpoint where a Gateway accepts\n                    network connections.\n                  properties:\n                    allowedRoutes:\n                      default:\n                        namespaces:\n                          from: Same\n                      description: |-\n                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a\n                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be\n                        present.\n\n                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule\n                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be\n                        determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.\n                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with\n                          a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over\n                          a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\".\n                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in\n                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence.

On the other\n                    hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.\n\n                  Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted\n                  as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match\n                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.\n\n                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any\n                  GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be\n                  ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the\n                  GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,\n                  `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.\n\n                  If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none\n                  match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by\n                  the implementation.

ReferenceGrant is\n                  not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to\n                  create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the\n                  Route.\n\n                  There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                  * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                  * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                  This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent\n                  resources.\n\n                  ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:\n\n                  * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef\n                    entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the\n                    multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n                    be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n                    each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n                    optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a\n                    combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.\n\n                  Some examples:\n\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the\n                    same object must also set `sectionName`.\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same\n                    object must also set `port`.\n                  * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs\n                    referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.\n\n                  It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may\n                  be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may\n                  choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the\n                  case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be\n                  merged.\n\n                  Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific\n                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly\n                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,\n                  Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a\n                  generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered\n                    a parent of this resource (usually a route).

An empty list\n                  means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    RouteParentStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an\n                    associated Parent.\n                  properties:\n                    conditions:\n                      description: |-\n                        Conditions describes the status of the route with respect to the Gateway.\n                        Note that the route's availability is also subject to the Gateway's own\n                        status conditions and listener status.\n\n                        If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports\n                        Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,\n                        then that Gateway's controller MUST set the \"Accepted\" condition on the\n                        Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the\n                        Gateway, and why.\n\n                        A Route MUST be considered \"Accepted\" if at least one of the Route's\n                        rules is implemented by the Gateway.\n\n                        There are a number of cases where the \"Accepted\" condition may not be set\n                        due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:\n\n                        * The Route refers to a nonexistent parent.\n                        * The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.\n                        * The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.\n                      items:\n                        description: Condition contains details for one aspect of\n                          the current state of this API Resource.\n                        properties:\n                          lastTransitionTime:\n                            description: |-\n                              lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.\n                              This should be when the underlying condition changed.

For example:\n\n                  * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at\n                    least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.\n                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes\n                    that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least\n                    one hostname that matches the Listener hostname.

That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match\n                  both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.\n\n                  If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any\n                  HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be\n                  ignored.

When both Port (experimental) and SectionName\n                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match\n                        both specified values.\n\n                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.\n                        If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is\n                        interpreted.\n\n                        When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.\n                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at\n                        least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway\n                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from\n                        the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the\n                        Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                        Support: Core\n                      maxLength: 253\n                      minLength: 1\n                      pattern: ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                      type: string\n                  required:\n                  - name\n                  type: object\n                maxItems: 32\n                type: array\n                x-kubernetes-list-type: atomic\n                x-kubernetes-validations:\n                - message: sectionName must be specified when parentRefs includes\n                    2 or more references to the same parent\n                  rule: 'self.all(p1, self.all(p2, p1.group == p2.group \u0026\u0026 p1.kind\n                    == p2.kind \u0026\u0026 p1.name == p2.name \u0026\u0026 (((!has(p1.__namespace__)\n                    || p1.__namespace__ == '''') \u0026\u0026 (!has(p2.__namespace__) || p2.__namespace__\n                    == '''')) || (has(p1.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026 has(p2.__namespace__) \u0026\u0026\n                    p1.__namespace__ == p2.__namespace__ )) ?

For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all\n                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.\n\n                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.\n                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in\n                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.\n\n                                            Request Path | Prefix Match | Replace Prefix | Modified Path\n                                          maxLength: 1024\n                                          type: string\n                                        type:\n                                          description: |-\n                                            Type defines the type of path modifier.

For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all\n                                            match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.\n\n                                            ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.\n                                            Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in\n                                            the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.\n\n                                            Request Path | Prefix Match | Replace Prefix | Modified Path\n                                          maxLength: 1024\n                                          type: string\n                                        type:\n                                          description: |-\n                                            Type defines the type of path modifier.

When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that\n                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when\n                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as\n                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.\n\n                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;\n                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at\n                  which to namespace this status.\n\n                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for\n                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST\n                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list\n                  that they are responsible for.\n\n                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs\n                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef\n                  and ControllerName fields combined.\n\n                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list\n                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.\n\n                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.\n                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that\n                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced\n                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no\n                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by\n                  the BackendTLSPolicy.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an\n                    associated Ancestor.\n\n                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it\n                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the\n                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and\n                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most\n                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations\n                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers\n                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.\n\n                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which\n                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy\n                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.\n\n                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the\n                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same\n                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying\n                    implementations.\n\n                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is\n                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.\n                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the\n                    ancestor object referred to in this status.\n\n                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the\n                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.\n\n                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,\n                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.\n                  properties:\n                    ancestorRef:\n                      description: |-\n                        AncestorRef corresponds with a ParentRef in the spec that this\n                        PolicyAncestorStatus struct describes the status of.\n                      properties:\n                        group:\n                          default: gateway.networking.k8s.io\n                          description: |-\n                            Group is the group of the referent.\n                            When unspecified, \"gateway.networking.k8s.io\" is inferred.\n                            To set the core API group (such as for a \"Service\" kind referent),\n                            Group must be explicitly set to \"\" (empty string).\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          pattern: ^$|^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                        kind:\n                          default: Gateway\n                          description: |-\n                            Kind is kind of the referent.\n\n                            There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                            * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                            Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.\n                          maxLength: 63\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-zA-Z]([-a-zA-Z0-9]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$\n                          type: string\n                        name:\n                          description: |-\n                            Name is the name of the referent.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          type: string\n                        namespace:\n                          description: |-\n                            Namespace is the namespace of the referent.

For example, Gateway\n                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from\n                            the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the\n                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                      required:\n                      - name\n                      type: object\n                    conditions:\n                      description: Conditions describes the status of the Policy with\n                        respect to the given Ancestor.\n                      items:\n                        description: Condition contains details for one aspect of\n                          the current state of this API Resource.\n                        properties:\n                          lastTransitionTime:\n                            description: |-\n                              lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.\n                              This should be when the underlying condition changed.

An empty list\n                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.\n\n                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.\n                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that\n                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced\n                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no\n                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by\n                  the BackendTLSPolicy.\n                items:\n                  description: |-\n                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an\n                    associated Ancestor.\n\n                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it\n                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the\n                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and\n                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most\n                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations\n                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers\n                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.\n\n                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which\n                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy\n                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.\n\n                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the\n                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same\n                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying\n                    implementations.\n\n                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is\n                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.\n                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the\n                    ancestor object referred to in this status.\n\n                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the\n                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.\n\n                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,\n                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.\n                  properties:\n                    ancestorRef:\n                      description: |-\n                        AncestorRef corresponds with a ParentRef in the spec that this\n                        PolicyAncestorStatus struct describes the status of.\n                      properties:\n                        group:\n                          default: gateway.networking.k8s.io\n                          description: |-\n                            Group is the group of the referent.\n                            When unspecified, \"gateway.networking.k8s.io\" is inferred.\n                            To set the core API group (such as for a \"Service\" kind referent),\n                            Group must be explicitly set to \"\" (empty string).\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          pattern: ^$|^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$\n                          type: string\n                        kind:\n                          default: Gateway\n                          description: |-\n                            Kind is kind of the referent.\n\n                            There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n                            * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n                            * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\n                            Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.\n                          maxLength: 63\n                          minLength: 1\n                          pattern: ^[a-zA-Z]([-a-zA-Z0-9]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$\n                          type: string\n                        name:\n                          description: |-\n                            Name is the name of the referent.\n\n                            Support: Core\n                          maxLength: 253\n                          minLength: 1\n                          type: string\n                        namespace:\n                          description: |-\n                            Namespace is the namespace of the referent.

It can be interpreted\n                            differently based on the type of parent resource.\n\n                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners\n                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and\n                            select this Route).

For example, Gateway\n                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                            namespace, or hostname.
